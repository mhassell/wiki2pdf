A tool for interacting with wikipedia.

Goals:

1. (done) download a wiki article to pdf

2. (done) include the option to download articles it links to

3. text to speech (need to parse just the article, and not the TeX code, index, links, and extra info)

4. export article as mp3 for an audiobook experience!
